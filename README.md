# Tree Data Structure

A **Tree** is a widely used data structure that simulates a hierarchical tree structure with a set of nodes. Each node contains a value or data and references to child nodes. Trees are used in many applications, including file systems, databases, and algorithms.

## Types of Tree Data Structures
Tree data structures can be classified based on the number of children each node can have. The main types are:

### 1. Binary Tree
A **Binary Tree** is a tree where each node can have at most two children, typically referred to as the "left" and "right" child. 

#### Common Types of Binary Trees:
- **Full Binary Tree**: Every node has 0 or 2 children.
- **Complete Binary Tree**: All levels except possibly the last are fully filled, and the last level has all nodes as left as possible.
- **Balanced Binary Tree**: The height difference between the left and right subtrees of any node is at most 1.
- **Degenerate (Pathological) Tree**: Each parent node has only one child, resembling a linked list.

#### Examples:
- **Binary Search Tree (BST)**: A binary tree where the left child contains values less than the parent node and the right child contains values greater than the parent node.
- **Binary Heap**: A complete binary tree satisfying the heap property (min-heap or max-heap).


### 2. Ternary Tree
A **Ternary Tree** is a tree where each node can have at most three children, commonly referred to as "left", "mid", and "right".

### 3. N-ary Tree (Generic Tree)
An **N-ary Tree** or **Generic Tree** is a tree where each node can have at most "N" children. The value of "N" can vary, making it flexible for different applications. Each node consists of data and a list of references to its children. Duplicate references are not allowed.

## Applications of Tree Data Structures
- Representing hierarchical data (e.g., file systems, organization charts).
- Search and sorting algorithms (e.g., BST, AVL Tree).
- Network routing algorithms.
- Expression parsing in compilers.
